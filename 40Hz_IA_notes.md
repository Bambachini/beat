# Impact of 40Hz

## Research Highlights
1. **Vocoder Log**:
   - Experiments with spectrogram sampling rates around 40Hz have displayed challenges in speech intelligibility and stability.
2. **Brain-Centric Study**:
   - Findings on inducing gamma activity in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using 40Hz tACS stimulation.

## Application Notes
- Alignment frequencies beyond sub-bass slightly enrich instrumental outputs.
- Integration methods design future-synchronized AI processes.
